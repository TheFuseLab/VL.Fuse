// Value Noise (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_noise), not to be confused with Perlin's
// Noise, is probably the simplest way to generate noise (a random smooth signal with 
// mostly all its energy in the low frequencies) suitable for procedural texturing/shading,
// modeling and animation.
//
// It produces lowe quality noise than Gradient Noise (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdXGW8)
// but it is slightly faster to compute. When used in a fractal construction, the blockyness
// of Value Noise gets qcuikly hidden, making it a very popular alternative to Gradient Noise.
//
// The principle is to create a virtual grid/latice all over the plane, and assign one
// random value to every vertex in the grid. When querying/requesting a noise value at
// an arbitrary point in the plane, the grid cell in which the query is performed is
// determined (line 30), the four vertices of the grid are determined and their random
// value fetched (lines 35 to 38) and then bilinearly interpolated (lines 35 to 38 again)
// with a smooth interpolant (line 31 and 33).
